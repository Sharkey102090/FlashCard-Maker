# New Features Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. ✅ Spaced Repetition System
**Location:** `src/core/spaced_repetition.py`

**Features:**
- **SuperMemo-based Algorithm**: Implements modified SM-2 algorithm with learning phases
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Cards are automatically scheduled based on performance
- **Learning Phases**: New cards go through learning steps (1 min, 10 min, 1 day)
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Ease factor adjusts based on how well you know each card
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks response times, success rates, and review history
- **Graduated Reviews**: Cards graduate from learning to review phase with longer intervals

**Key Classes:**
- `SpacedRepetitionEngine`: Main algorithm implementation
- `ReviewData`: Stores individual card review statistics
- `ReviewResult`: Enum for rating difficulty (Again, Hard, Good, Easy)

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.core.spaced_repetition import spaced_repetition, ReviewResult

# Review a card
spaced_repetition.review_card(card_id, ReviewResult.GOOD, response_time=3.5)

# Get cards due for review
due_cards = spaced_repetition.get_due_cards(all_card_ids)

# Get comprehensive statistics
stats = spaced_repetition.get_study_stats(card_ids)
```
